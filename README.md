A Flutter e-commerce app I built to practice clean architecture patterns with GetX. 
Includes both customer and admin sides - users can browse products and checkout, 
while admins get a dashboard to manage inventory and orders. Still using mock data 
for now but the structure is ready for a real backend. Feel free to use it as a 
starting point for your own projects.
