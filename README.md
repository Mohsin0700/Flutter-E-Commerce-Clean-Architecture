A Flutter e-commerce app I built to practice clean architecture patterns with GetX. 
Includes both customer and admin sides - users can browse products and checkout, 
while admins get a dashboard to manage inventory and orders. Still using mock data 
for now but the structure is ready for a real backend. Feel free to use it as a 
starting point for your own projects.


Or if you want something even shorter:

Full-featured e-commerce app in Flutter with GetX state management. 
Has customer shopping flow and admin panel for managing products/orders. 
Built with clean architecture so it's easy to extend and maintain.
